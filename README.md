# tool-rewrites
A place where I (re)write offensive tools, if and when I remember that this repo exists.

Note: This repo is only for security education purposes - you don't have permission to use the code in this GH to attack things without consent.

## Projects

I've done my best to structure these projects in decent ways, and it's worth noting that a lot of times these projects are mega-WIP - the code you see may not be a final product. That said, here's the list of projects I eventually want to tackle:

* Command-and-control server and client
* Directory brute forcer (a la gobuster or dirbuster)
* A hash-cracking program
* Everybody's favorite, a port scanner
* Shellcode generator
* Traffic sniffer (think Wireshark, but way less complex)
* A web proxy

Speaking of projects, here's *hopefully* the list of languages I'd like to write them all in:
* Python3 (my most familiar)
* Ruby
* Go
* C
* C++

This is as much for me to learn while I code as it is for you to learn from it, dear reader, so forgive me as I fumble through some things. Happy hacking!
